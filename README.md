## Getting Started

### Installation

#### MacOS

Follow these steps to set up your development environment on MacOS:

```bash
# Install GCC
brew install armmbed/formulae/arm-none-eabi-gcc
# If you encounter issues with Brew when installing GCC, switch to manual installation:
# Visit https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/gnu-rm, and select the `9-2020-q2-update`

# Install Rust
# For instructions, visit https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
rustup install nightly-2023-06-26
rustup target add thumbv7em-none-eabihf
cargo install bindgen-cli
cargo install cbindgen

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/KeystoneHQ/keystone3-firmware --recursive
```

#### Docker

Alternatively, use Docker to build the required environment:

```bash
docker build -t keystone3-baker:local .
```

### Building the Firmware

Here's how to build the Keystone3 Firmware:

#### Building multi-coins firmware

```bash
# Run the build script at the root of the project.
python3 build.py
```

#### Building btc-only firmware

```bash
# Run the build script at the root of the project.
python build.py -t btc_only
```

#### Building img to C file

Please move the "img" file to the corresponding directory under the "images" directory.

The program will convert underscores in the file names to camel case, and add the appropriate prefix to the files.

Here are two ways to run it.

The first way is to execute the command below.

```bash
# Run the build script at the root of the project.
python img_converter.py
```

The second way is already integrated in the "build.py" file, so you can simply use it.

```bash
python3 build.py

# or
python build.py -t btc_only
```
