Receive,receive_btc_more_t,Tutorial,
,receive_btc_more_t_title1,What are the three different address formats for BTC?,
,receive_btc_more_t_desc1,"Bitcoin (BTC) uses three address formats for receiving funds:
1. Native SegWit is the most efficient and secure Bitcoin address format. It provides cost savings and improved security compared to other traditional address formats,typically starting with ""bc1""
2. Legacy address format is one of the earliest versions of Bitcoin, typically starting with ""1""
3. Nested SegWit is a solution designed to facilitate the transition to Native SegWit in a smooth manner, typically starting with ""3""",

,receive_btc_more_t_title2,Can the three different address formats be used to transfer funds to each other?,
,receive_btc_more_t_desc2,"Yes, the three distinct Bitcoin address formats can be used for transferring funds among each other. However, it’s important to keep in mind the following aspects:
1. Differing transaction fees: The choice of address format can influence transaction fees, with Native SegWit addresses generally having lower fees.
2. Wallet and exchange compatibility: Make sure that the wallet or exchange you are using supports your chosen address format. Some wallets may only be compatible with specific address formats.",

,receive_btc_more_t_title3,Advantages of Avoiding Address Reuse,
,receive_btc_more_t_desc3,"1. Privacy: Reusing addresses increases transaction traceability, endangering privacy. New addresses help maintain transaction privacy.
2. Transaction Efficiency: Multiple UTXOs linked to one address can raise costs for consolidation, impacting wallet efficiency.
3. Security: Repeated address use heightens the risk of private key exposure, potentially leading to losses if compromised.
In short, not reusing addresses safeguards privacy, optimizes transactions, and reduces security risks within the UTXO model.",
