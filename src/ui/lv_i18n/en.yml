  receive_btc_more_t_desc1: "Bitcoin (BTC) uses three address formats for receiving\
    \ funds:\r\n1. Native SegWit is the most efficient and secure Bitcoin address\
    \ format. It provides cost savings and improved security compared to other traditional\
    \ address formats,typically starting with \"bc1\"\r\n2. Legacy address format\
    \ is one of the earliest versions of Bitcoin, typically starting with \"1\"\r\n\
    3. Nested SegWit is a solution designed to facilitate the transition to Native\
    \ SegWit in a smooth manner, typically starting with \"3\""
  receive_btc_more_t_desc2: "Yes, the three distinct Bitcoin address formats can be\
    \ used for transferring funds among each other. However, it\u2019s important to\
    \ keep in mind the following aspects:\r\n1. Differing transaction fees: The choice\
    \ of address format can influence transaction fees, with Native SegWit addresses\
    \ generally having lower fees.\r\n2. Wallet and exchange compatibility: Make sure\
    \ that the wallet or exchange you are using supports your chosen address format.\
    \ Some wallets may only be compatible with specific address formats."
  receive_btc_more_t_desc3: "1. Privacy: Reusing addresses increases transaction traceability,\
    \ endangering privacy. New addresses help maintain transaction privacy.\r\n2.\
    \ Transaction Efficiency: Multiple UTXOs linked to one address can raise costs\
    \ for consolidation, impacting wallet efficiency.\r\n3. Security: Repeated address\
    \ use heightens the risk of private key exposure, potentially leading to losses\
    \ if compromised.\r\nIn short, not reusing addresses safeguards privacy, optimizes\
    \ transactions, and reduces security risks within the UTXO model."
